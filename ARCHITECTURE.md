## Summary

The system follows a multi-agent pipeline architecture:

1. **Orchestrator**: Coordinates the workflow
2. **Research Agent**: Gathers and synthesizes information
3. **Writer Agent**: Generates content based on research
4. **Image Agent**: Curates visual content
5. **Publisher Agent**: Handles multi-platform distribution
