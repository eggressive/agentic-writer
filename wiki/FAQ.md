You can also define custom styles using the Python API.

### Can I specify my target audience?

Yes! Use the `--audience` parameter:

```bash
python main.py create "Your Topic" --audience "software developers"
```

Be specific for best results: "small business owners", "college students studying CS", etc.

### Where are the generated articles saved?

By default, articles are saved in the `output/` directory as:

- `article_title.md` - Markdown file
- `article_title_metadata.json` - Metadata file

You can specify a custom directory with `--output-dir`.

### Can I publish directly to Medium?

Yes, if you have a Medium API token:

1. Add `MEDIUM_ACCESS_TOKEN` to your `.env` file
1. Use `--platform medium` when creating content

Note: Medium API support is prepared but requires testing with a valid token.

### Does it support images?

Yes! The system searches Unsplash for relevant images. You need an Unsplash API key for this feature. Without it, the system will still work but won't include images.

## Features & Capabilities

### What topics can I write about?

Almost anything! The system works best with:

- Technology topics
- Business and entrepreneurship
- Education and tutorials
- Science and research
- Health and wellness
- Personal development

Avoid:

- Topics requiring very recent information (within last 24 hours)
- Highly specialized niche topics with limited web information
- Illegal or harmful content

### Can it write in multiple languages?

Currently, it primarily generates English content. The system can attempt other languages, but quality may vary. Multi-language support is planned for future releases.

### Does it check for plagiarism?

No, the system does not currently include plagiarism checking. However, content is original as it's generated by AI based on research synthesis. Plagiarism detection is planned for a future release (see [Roadmap](Roadmap.md)).

### Can I use this for commercial purposes?

Yes! Agentic-Writer is licensed under MIT License, which allows commercial use. However:

- Review generated content before publishing
- Ensure compliance with your industry regulations
- Follow OpenAI's usage policies
- Respect copyright and attribution

### Does it do SEO optimization?

Basic SEO features are included:

- Meta descriptions
- Relevant tags
- Proper heading structure

Advanced SEO features (keyword optimization, readability scores, etc.) are planned for future releases.

## Technical Questions

### Can I use a different AI model?

Yes! Set the model in your `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo-preview
# or
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
```

Support for other providers (Claude, Gemini, local models) is planned.

### Can I run this offline?

No, internet connection is required for:

- OpenAI API calls
- Web research (DuckDuckGo)
- Image search (Unsplash)

However, local LLM support is planned for future releases.

### Is there a rate limit?

Rate limits depend on your OpenAI account tier:

- Free tier: Limited requests per minute
- Pay-as-you-go: Higher limits
- Enterprise: Custom limits

The system includes automatic retry logic to handle rate limits.

### Can I run multiple instances simultaneously?

Yes, but be mindful of:

- OpenAI rate limits
- API costs
- System resources

Each instance operates independently.

### How do I update to the latest version?

```bash
cd agentic-writer
git pull origin main
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Can I contribute to the project?

Absolutely! See our [Contributing Guide](Contributing.md) for how to get started.

## Troubleshooting

### "OPENAI_API_KEY is required but not set"

Add your API key to the `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

### "Rate limit exceeded"

You've hit your OpenAI rate limit. Solutions:

- Wait a few minutes
- Upgrade your OpenAI account
- Use a slower model (gpt-3.5-turbo)

### Generated content quality is poor

Try:

- Use GPT-4 or GPT-4 Turbo
- Increase temperature for creativity
- Provide more specific topics
- Define your audience clearly
- Adjust writing style

### Article is too short/long

Currently, length is fixed at 1200-1500 words. Configurable length is planned for a future release.

### Images aren't being included

Possible causes:

- No Unsplash API key configured
- Network issues
- API rate limit reached

The system continues without images if Unsplash fails.

### It's taking too long

Normal! Content creation takes 2-5 minutes. If longer:

- Check internet connection
- Verify OpenAI API status
- Try using gpt-3.5-turbo for speed
- Reduce MAX_RESEARCH_SOURCES

For more troubleshooting, see our [Troubleshooting Guide](Troubleshooting.md).

No:

- Memory: 100-200 MB
- CPU: Low (mostly waiting for APIs)
- Network: Moderate
- Disk: Minimal

### Can it handle batch processing?

Yes, you can process multiple topics:

```python
topics = ["Topic 1", "Topic 2", "Topic 3"]
for topic in topics:
    results = orchestrator.create_content(topic, ...)
```

Be mindful of API rate limits and costs.
